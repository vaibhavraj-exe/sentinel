## Problem Statement

- In today's digital age, children are increasingly exposed
to online communication platforms where they can interact
with others through chats and messages.

- However, this virtual environment comes with inherent
risks, including exposure to profanity and inappropriate
language.

- The lack of effective tools to monitor and filter out such
language poses a significant threat to children's safety
and well-being.

- Without adequate safeguards in place, children may be
subjected to harmful content that can negatively impact
their emotional and psychological development.
